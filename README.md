**task 1** The program contains descriptions of the objects director, 
accountant, worker in the corresponding classes. The Runner class 
displays information about these objects using the method declared 
in the IRole interface.

**task 2** The program displays information about the area and perimeter 
of various geometric shapes. Each figure has a corresponding class 
inherited from the abstract class Figure. In which abstract methods 
are declared for calculating area and perimeter. The Runner class 
displays shape parameter information using a for loop from a one-dimensional 
array of Fig. And it calculates the total sum of the perimeters of all figures.
